For this assigment, I chose to use the data set "2015 Street Tree Census" from the samples provided. I chose this because I wanted to represent data in the form of a map, and looking at the dataset, I immediately had an idea of how I would want to visualize it. 
I first started of by collecting the data for the latitude and longitude, that thus, became the x and y positions of the tree data. 
Then, I used the color to indicate the health of the tree using if statements. 
I am also playing around with printing the name of the tree when the particular point is clicked.
